# Surfs Up Module 9 Challenge
## Student: Christopher Mastrangelo 

### Purpose
We were asked to look at a database of weather observations for the island of Oahu in Hawaii to analyze temperature and precipitation trends over multiple years.  For the Challenge we specifically looked at temperature data, but in the course materials we also looked at precipitation. Some trends and findings are included below.

### Findings 

Our comparison of the temperatures in June and December reveals that because of its location in the tropics, the climate of Hawaii is consistent in both summer and winter, so it would be feasible for an ice cream store to remain open all year round.

### Additional Analysis

Temperature data seems consistent and probably would not vary much on the same island.  But because the Surf shop side of the business could be more dependent on the precipitation, as well as wind speed and other weather related data, I would recommend to do a comparison of precipitation data by time of year as well as filtering on the location of the weather station, to determine if some locations on Oahu have more favorable surfing conditions.
